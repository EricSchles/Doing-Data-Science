# Doing-Data-Science

In this book I will be teaching you data science from a different perspective.  From the perspective of data science from the perspective of philosophy.
I think this framing is good, mostly because data science is about understanding the world around you, with data.  That's pretty much what philosophy is about 
as well.  

The difference will be the techniques we will use - mostly computational.  However we will also be using lots of actual thinking, from philosophy.  Thus by defining
data science from the perspective of taking techniques that are computational and non-computational to learn truth.  The major way this difference will manifest is how
we ask questions of our data, how we frame our analysis and to some degree, what our end goal will be.

I wish I could start with a concrete example, but to do that, I'd have to assume you already know philosophy and be familiar with it in general, which I cannot do. Therefore
I cannot offer concrete examples of this until I define things, lots of things.  Therefore, I can only provide a table of contents, specifically on how I will define things 
so that I can provide you with examples.

###Table of Contents

Part 1 - Building up our tool box to do philosophical data science

1. Understanding how to make logical arguments

Description: Here I will explain the set of logical argument techniques that we will use to prove claims.  They will be things like
deduction, induction, abduction, and others.

2. Understanding how to make counter arguments

Description:  Here I will explain how to use the above techniques that we used to prove simple claims to disprove other claims, or to provide counter
arguments.

3.  Bringing in Logical notation

Description:  Here I will bring in logical notation so that we may understand syntax of logical arguments and counter arguments.

4.  Bringing in Semantics

Description:  In the previous chapter I taught you how to recognize logical arguments and deduce them to meaningless syntax.  I also introduced
how to use code to do logic.  Here I bring back in semantic meaning, to show how to define truth, levels of truth, and gain knowledge.

5.  From Semantics to Data

Description:  In the previous chapter we talked about knowledge and formally defined it.  Here I will describe how semantic information can be gained
from data.  I will show a first computational technique - getting data.  This data will be used to inform the semantics of the argument I will make.

6.  From arguments created by a human to arguments created by a mathematical model and humans

Description:  In this chapter the first mathematical model will be introduced and instead of drawing a conclusion from pure and simple reason
it will be drawn with a mathematical model.  The mathematical model will be used with a number of different data sets to show different kinds of truth.

7.  Expanding our set of argument types

Description:  In this chapter I will add many more mathematical models to the quiver to show more knowledge but also to show different types of information.

8.  Making counter arguments with mathematical models

Description:  In this chapter I will show how different mathematical models and data cleaning techniques can be used to show two different sets of truth.  
Some of that truth will be overlapping and some of it will not be.  Thus I will have shown that using data science one can construct different conclusions.

9.  Expansion of tools

Description:  In this chapter I will bring in a richer set of mathematical models and show how they can be used in the previous chapter to create even more perspectives.
I will also include a richer set of data cleaning, data collection, data visualization, and data generating techniques.

Part 2: Answering hard questions

Description:  In this part I will begin to answer real questions with the perspective of philosophical data science that I've developed in part 1.
I'll look at each industry in particular and ask hard questions about it and then set out to answer them using data science

In this part I will take a step back and look at the chalk board of stuff I've written down and begin to look for general patterns.
